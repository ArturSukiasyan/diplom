When considering features to implement in a Spring Boot application
related to the Doctor-Patient relationship, there are several options
that can enhance the user experience and improve the overall
functionality of the application. Here are a few features you might
consider:

1 - Appointment Scheduling: Implement a feature that allows patients to
schedule appointments with doctors conveniently. This can include
features such as selecting a preferred doctor, choosing an available
time slot, and receiving appointment confirmations.

2 - Patient Profile Management: Enable patients to create and manage their
profiles within the application. This can include features like updating
personal information, medical history, allergies, and medication
details. Additionally, you can provide options to upload and store
important documents like medical reports and prescriptions.

3 - Doctor Availability and Booking: Provide information about doctors'
availability, including their working hours, availability for online
consultations, and any upcoming leave or unavailability. This will help
patients make informed decisions when scheduling appointments.

4 - Secure Messaging: Implement a secure messaging system that allows
patients and doctors to communicate directly within the application.
This feature can enable patients to ask questions, seek clarifications,
or discuss concerns with their doctors conveniently and confidentially.

5 - Prescription and Medical Records: Incorporate a feature that allows
doctors to generate digital prescriptions and share them directly with
patients. Additionally, provide a centralized repository for storing
medical records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and lab results.
This will facilitate easy access to information for both patients and
doctors.

6 - Telemedicine or Video Consultations: Integrate a video consultation
feature that enables doctors and patients to have virtual appointments
when an in-person visit is not required. This can be especially useful
for follow-up consultations, minor queries, or situations where physical
presence is challenging.

7 - Appointment Reminders and Notifications: Implement automated appointment
reminders and notifications to help patients remember their upcoming
appointments. This can be achieved through email, SMS, or push
notifications, based on the user's preferences.

8 - Reviews and Ratings: Allow patients to provide feedback and rate their
experience with doctors. This feature can help other patients make
informed decisions when selecting a healthcare provider and contribute
to building trust within the application.

Remember to prioritize the features based on the specific needs and
goals of your application and the resources available for development.
